    <h2>How it works?</h2>
    <ol style="text-align: left;">
        <li>NPOs initiate projects by providing specific plans in different phases, target amount and beneficiary.
        </li>
        <li>Donors select prefered projects and donate certain amount of money into an Escrow account.</li>
        <li>When the funding in escrow account reaches 60% of target amount, 30% of target amount would be transferred to NPOs account as Phase 1.</li>
<li>NPOs use donations as planned and contact suppliers to get materials.
</li>
<li>Supplies shipped to the beneficiary.</li>
<li>Beneficiary checks quality of the delivery and provides feedbacks regarding to Phase 1.</li>
<li>If the beneficiary thinks the delivery is qualified, the funding process will continue to next phase.</li>
<li>As funding amount reaches 80% of the target amount, another 40% of target amount would be transferred to NPOs account as Phase 2.</li>
<li>The same transactions continue as funding processed to the final Phase.</li>
<li>During any phases, if the beneficiary doesn’t get the delivery or received disqualified suppliers,
the funding would be ceased.</li>
<li>Funding remaining in the escrow account would be returned to donors respectively.</li>
